## Plugins

<Aside emoji="⚠️">
  Currently, only config extension API is implemented, and it will likely change. Generator hooks (for `tablegen`,
  `worldgen`, etc) and cli extension API will be available in the future.

Plugins are just npm packages that export an object defined via `defineMUDPlugin`.

The `config` package provides the core of MUD API.
Both `store` and `world` are plugins themselves, although `store` is special because it introduces `mudConfig`.

Plugins can depend on other plugins, and most are expected to depend on `store` and `world`.

### Plugins for the MUD framework

MUD framework means that your plugin will depend on `world`, which in turn depends on `store`.

Start with [`Basic plugin example`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/blob/main/examples/minimal/packages/plugin-example/ts), which shows how to add an option (but it does nothing with it).

Plugins can take advantage of [Modules](world/modules) to add solidity logic to `world`.

You can use [`world/ts`](https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/blob/main/packages/world/ts) as an advanced example, since `world` is a plugin.
